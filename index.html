		<p id="about">When Leia isn't enjoying any of the above things, she likes to peruse her favorite website <a href="http://moderndogmagazine.com/" target="_blank">The Modern Dog Magazine</a>. Leia, being a very savvy puppy who loves website design knows this site utalizes a lot of javascript in the code. It also uses <b>div</b> tags to group content together, as well as <b>classes</b> and <b>ids</b>, which are used in CSS. This site is great and utalizes the divs well to block content together to stack it on top of each other.<br /><br />

		But let's be honest, it's mostly sleeping.
